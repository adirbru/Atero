# Solution - Adir Bruchim

Final solution can be seen under sprompt/client/solution_client.py
when running main. You can choose to run with optimize_cpu=False for best time performance.

## Looking at the code and identifying hotspots
I ran cProfile to identify the most time-consuming functions in the client run
```
python -m cProfile -o output.prof client/naive_client.py 
snakeviz output.prof
```

And found the following:

We can use caching to store the specific parameters used for each of the functions to make them run faster.
<br> While we could cache `security_level` and `additional_rules` separately, allowing caching different rules under the same policy and still save some time,
There are other actions in `create_policy` involves heavy calculations on the policy itself, derived from these parameters.
<br> Therefore - I'd prefer caching the function as a whole.
<br> I made the function replacing it generic in case I'd change my mind about the other functions.

>I also noticed in the code and not from the cProfile analysis there were other `time ü•Å` consuming functions in prompt_security_engine.
Both in the constructor and in the prompt processing function.

## Solution
>üêí-patching `create_policy` to use cached objects when passed same security_level and additional_rules.
<br>I used the generic function `cached_method_wrapper`. 

>Overriding both the constructor and the `process_prompt` functions in PromptSecurityEngine based on the policy. 
<br> Since the policy is an object - this involved pickle and therefore was a bit harsher on the cpu.
> This can be controlled using the `optimize_cpu` flag

## Followup
- Use another level of cache (separate `additional_rules` and `security_level` for example) to allow other faster actions
- Split the policy and the prompts caches
